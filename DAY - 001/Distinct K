PROBLEM STATEMENT:-

You wish to help Ashish, who possesses a collection of N strings, some of which may be duplicated, and has been assigned the task of finding the kth unique string.
If the number of unique strings is less than k, he needs to display -1. Considering you are Ashish's best friend can you assist him with this challenge?

Input Format
The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of strings.
The next N lines contain strings.
The next line contains an integer k.

Output Format
The output contains the kth distinct string. If there are less than k unique string display -1.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= String.length() <= 10^3

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
6
d
b
c
b
c
a
2
Testcase Output
a
Explanation
The only strings in arr that are distinct are "d" and "a." The letter "d" comes first, making it the first separate string.
Because "a" appears second, it is the second distinct string. "a" is returned since k == 2.

Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
3
dac
ba
a
1 
Testcase Output
dac
Explanation
As all the strings are unique we have the strings in the order: 
dac, ba, a

Now, as we can see the value of k=1 therefore, the string returned is the 1st unique string = dac.

CODE:-

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
def find_kth_unique_string(n, strings, k):
    unique_strings = {}
    unique_values = []

    for string in strings:
        if string not in unique_strings:
            unique_strings[string] = 1
        else:
            unique_strings[string] += 1

    for string, count in unique_strings.items():
        if count == 1:
            unique_values.append(string)

        if len(unique_values) == k:
            return string

    return -1

n = int(input())
strings = [input() for _ in range(n)]
k = int(input())

result = find_kth_unique_string(n, strings, k)
print(result)

EXPLAINATION:-
1. Create a dictionary to store the frequency of each string.
2. Iterate through the list of strings and update the frequency in the dictionary.
3. Create a list to store the unique strings.
4. Iterate through the dictionary and add strings with a frequency of 1 to the unique strings list.
5. Check if the length of the unique strings list is greater than or equal to k.
6. If true, return the kth unique string. Otherwise, return -1.
